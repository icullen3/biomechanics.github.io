## Locomotion Mode Classification based on Wearable Sensosr data from Lower Limb Biomechanics 

### Introduction
Characterization of human movement and understanding of corresponding muscle coordination over various locmotion modes and terrain conditions is crucial for determining human movement strategies in environments more prevalent to community ambulation. Biomechanical data captured during locomotion, such as, Electromyography (EMG) signlas, can be used to anticipate transitions from one mode to another.

### Problem Definition
The [dataset](http://www.epic.gatech.edu/opensource-biomechanics-camargo-et-al/) for the project has been acquired by EPIC Lab at Georgia Tech. The dataset contains 3-dimensional biomechanical and wearable sensor data along with the kinematic and kinetic profiles of joint biomechanics (as a function of gait phase) from 22 able-bodied adults for 5 locomotion modes (e.g. level-ground or treadmill walking, stair-ascent, stair-descent, ramp-ascent and ramp-descent) and multiple terain conidtions for each mode (walking speed, stair height, and ramp inclination) [1].

In this project, we will develop subject-dependent classicifation models for 6 possible modes (standing and 5 locomotion modes) regardless of their terrain conditions based on biomechanics data captured from lower limb using EMG, Goniometer, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) etc. from able-bodied participants for a single adult (e.g. AB21 from the dataset).

### Methods

### Broader Impact
The broader impact of this project would be future development of robotic assistive devices for targeted rehabilitation methods. and improvement of biomimetic controllers that better adapt to terrain conditions (practical scenarios).
