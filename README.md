## Ambulation Classification based on Lower Limb Biomechanics

The [dataset](http://www.epic.gatech.edu/opensource-biomechanics-camargo-et-al/) has been acquired by EPIC Lab at Georgia Tech. 

In this project, we will classify 6 ambulation modes (walking, standing, stair - ascent, stair - descent, ramp - ascent, ramp - descent) based on biomechanics data captured from lower limb using EMG, Goniometer, IMU etc. from able-bodied participants.
