## Locomotion Mode Classification based on Waerable Sensosr data from Lower Limb Biomechanics 

### Introduction
The [dataset](http://www.epic.gatech.edu/opensource-biomechanics-camargo-et-al/) has been acquired by EPIC Lab at Georgia Tech. The dataset contains 3-dimensional biomechanical and wearable sensor data along with the kinematic and kinetic profiles of joint biomechanics (as a function of gait phase) from 22 able-bodied adults for 5 locomotion modes (e.g. level-ground or treadmill walking, stair-ascent, stair-descent, ramp-ascent and ramp-descent) and multiple terain conidtions for each mode (walking speed, stair height, and ramp inclination).

In this project, we will dveelop subject-dependent classicifation models for 6 possible modes (standing and 5 locomotion modes) regardless of their terrain conditions based on biomechanics data captured from lower limb using EMG, Goniometer, IMU etc. from able-bodied participants for a single adult (e.g. AB21 from the dataset).

### Methods

### Broader Impact
The broader impact of this project would be future development of robotic assistive devices. and imprvement of biomimetic controllers that better adapt to terrain conditions.
